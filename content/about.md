            We are a small indie studio created by the passion we have for both playing and creating games. We make videogames with the viewpoint of what the player wants in the it, not what the industry follows as a trend.
        </p>
        <p>
            We plan to create games that can be completely enjoyed from the moment you buy them, no abusive DLCs that give you things that were already in the game when it was launched, microtransactions, or season passes.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe single player will keep having a special place in gamer's hearths and, even thought they say single player games are dying, games like ours are focused to prove the contrary.

            Making videogames is a very vast art, with this premise, a good artist direction is one of the more important things in a videogame, from a simple chair to the more complex enemy, each one has their dedication.
